In 1998 I was curious why on how to get mp3 to play back on embedded devices. The first 6 months to a year were full of failures. Processors were not powerful enough, storage was expensive, there was no business case. Nonetheless I built a fixed function player from a breadboard in 1998 the below products followed. The entire source code for embedded media players can be found [here](https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/adotcorporation). I was lucky enough to work with super smart engineers while I developed business cases and partners. 

One of the firsts multi-codec mp3 players created with removable media - the Clik! drive. The software stack for the Iomega Hipzip, built upon eCos which was called Dadio OS, source code [here](https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/iomega_hipzip).  The player supported MP3, WMA, and Ogg Vorbis formats.  This device and the IBM 120 MB CF drive were the examplars for the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/patents/us7667123.pdf">playlist (Patent No.: US 7,667,123 B2, Date of Patent: Feb.23,2010)</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/patents/us7574272.pdf">buffering (Patent No.: US 7,574,272 B2, Date of Patent: Aug.11,2009)</a> patents.
