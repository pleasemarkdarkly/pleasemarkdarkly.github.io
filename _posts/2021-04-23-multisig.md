__TLDR__

Generating a multi-signature wallet is as easy as pushing a button. Spending from a multi-signature wallet where the transaction is built manually is demonstrated below with support for both TestNet and MainNet. 

Bitcoin wallets are complicated. Additionally, if you make a mistake with regards to transferring funds, using incorrect addresses, you can potentially lose all your money. With great power comes responsibility. To deal with the every complicated world of Bitcoin addresses, [multi-signature address schemes](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multi-signature) were introduced and made secure with Segregated Witness (Segwit) also referred to as [BIP-143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0143.mediawiki). In short, previously to this Bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) one of the signers of a multi-signature address could spend about two weeks of work to manipulate the script involved in the address management to pay themselves all the funds. 

The following TestNet [Multi-Signature Address/Spending Tool](https://stupefied-hopper-853f87.netlify.app/?testnet=true) allows anyone to experiment with the address creation, and spending/authorization workflow without worry of losing funds. MainNet [Multi-Signature](https://stupefied-hopper-853f87.netlify.app/) should be only for those that know what they are doing. Here are some simple instructions to play with transactions on TestNet. 

* I've prepared a sample multisig wallet which you can use [Example Multi-Signature Wallet]({{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/multisig-ex-testnet.pdf). Or you can create your own multisig wallet and spending scheme. 
* Testnet addresses, such at the `2MySu6ck8Ni6nXoXmSKNYM8UH7xh6Zmyh7e` (also represented as the above QR code) can easily get funds from Bitcoin TestNet faucets. [Here](https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/), [here](https://kuttler.eu/en/bitcoin/btc/faucet/) and [here](https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/).
* The multisig example contains an address which has 3 keys each with public and private key pairs. The redeem script contains the logic with requires 2 of the 3 keys to spend from the multisig address. Again, this is a TestNet example so there is no fear of losing actual funds.

Address: 2MySu6ck8Ni6nXoXmSKNYM8UH7xh6Zmyh7e

Public/Private Key Pair 1:

Public: 0261e395ff62fc11c13827ce10e4268d081853c74e634d314cfc20d7212b313981

Private: cUuNqNoUm35PHF17ViVDzy6df3ea4cUFJvANE5gAoZsc5HnsrteA


Public/Private Key Pair 2: 

Public: 02b0722b61e8d2980740e1b396a48bfb51bd5bf01c270f03b0bdcbe31c7e6766dd

Private: cW7fzKKHwveVVKRvS436cxhuRfoKPVVd5DeQRoCHXoNk32TKBKqv

Public/Private Key Pair 3: 

Public: 02409b749a4812e2b5a0b46b588898e046b55ab823db5060fdcb014eb854e68ac6

Private: cSWrsJ12q2QQ76t197ZAUABvE1GQdfLzSaBw4zEupo3hPsEb26iX

Redeem script:

_The order of the keys is important._

* Navigating to [build multisig](https://stupefied-hopper-853f87.netlify.app/multisig-build.html), select TestNet, add the above address `2MySu6ck8Ni6nXoXmSKNYM8UH7xh6Zmyh7e` by way of copy/paste or using the browser camera to scan the address from the aforementioned pdf. Finally, select [Get UTXOs](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/UTXO). UTXOs are how the Bitcoin network stores value and in effect what balance you have at your address. At this time of this writing, using one of the above listed faucets, the following was returned:

```json
[
  {
    "txid": "1cedd4314e4ff52c65714a824143fbb806ef5ba3f53ade6ff43fe15479fdb180",
    "vout": 0,
    "satoshis": 1557379
  }
]
```

* Selecting `LOAD` converts each `UTXOs` into a blue box with the number of Satoshis available to spend. By selecting the blue box and designating an output address, change address and miner fee. I used my own address for the change output and the original faucet as the output address, leaving 200 or for a miner fee.
* Selecting `Build` generates a transaction which now needs to be signed by 2 of the 3 public/private key holders from the original multi-sig address creation.
* Copy the data generated after the `Build` button and navigate to [Sign Multi-Sig Transactions](https://stupefied-hopper-853f87.netlify.app/multisig-sign.html).
* Selecting TestNet, pasting the redeem and copying/pasting the private key or scanning with the helper `Scan with WebCam`, finally paste in the HEX values from the previous step, the transaction. Each private key used to sign the transaction which is NOT the final key, use the `Sign Incomplete` button.
* Save each signing transaction output to paste into the transaction signing box until your final private key signature.
* Your final transaction has been built, and now needs to be broadcasts to the [network.](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/pushtx/)
