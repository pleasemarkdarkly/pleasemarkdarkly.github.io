When Amazon opened up their online store API, as a joke we created this website that would track peer to peer loans and remind parties when the loan was due or the item needed to be returned. During the expiration period, the system would remind the parties, as well as provide options for each party to replace the item or gift the item using Amazon Web Services. While the idea was cute, no one used the services. We blame marketing.
