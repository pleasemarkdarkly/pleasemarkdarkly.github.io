When Amazon opened up their online store API, as a joke we created this website that would track peer to peer loans and remind parties when the loan was due or the item needed to be returned. During the expiration period, while the system would remind the parties it would also provide options to the parties to replace the load items with Amazon replacement through affiliate links. While the idea was cute, no one used the services. We blame marketing.
