# What is Uniswap?
[Uniswap](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core) is a peer-to-contract (you interacting with a Smart Contract) designed to exchange cryptocurrencies (ERC-20) on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradeable smart contracts - thus prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access. Once the Uniswap protocol is deployed, the smart contracts function in perpetuity, with 100% uptime, as long as the Ethereum blockchain exists.

English: Fancy exchanges do matching of buyers and sellers and make money on fees and spreads. Uniswap automates willing (competitive) providers of liquidity (tokens, such as an ERC-20 token and ETH) who earn interest (via fees), while others pay fees to swap their tokens. Not only does Uniswap cut out the middle man (insert Exchange name here), but they have removed any barriers for who lists. Instead of Coinbase deciding which tokens they support, anyone can list their token.  It is not unheard of for exchanges to seek payment for listing tokens (think companies seeking to list their shares when they go public), Uniswap does not charge a listing fee for a token to be available.

# How do exchanges work?
Normally, an exchange keeps track of what orders (or who) wants to buy or sell any asset. Users of such exchanges may not see the other orders, or see them with any timeliness. During these exchanges, someone who is selling low and someone who wants to buy high, the exchange can provide the asset to both parties and earn both the fees for the transaction on the market and the 'spread' between purchasing low from one user and selling higher to another. Another scenario is when the market has more sell orders then buy orders, driving the price of the asset down, the exchange may purchase these assets in order to prioritize selling their holdings when the market price later is driven up. Effectively, if sellers and buyers are not trading, then this activity leads to lack or decreased liquidity. 

# How does Uniswap work?
Uniswap creates liquidity pools or LP, which providers are participants in earning interest and fees as incentive to create a reservoir which mitigate liquidity issues. Uniswap's smart contracts are algorithmically analyzing the LPs for the most optimized prices for each trade. This automation is generally called automated market maker technology.

# The Constant Product Formula
Uniswap uses the _constant product formula_ (x*y=k) to swap from token to token. Prior to an exchange, liquidity with the tokens much exists.

# How many versions of Uniswap are there?
There are three versions of the Uniswap protocol, [V1](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v1) and [V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core) are open source and licensed under GPL and [V3](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core) is a [derivative of the MariaDB license, open source with slight modifications.](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE)

# Uniswap Smart Contract Integration
Feel free to clone my Github repo of the project or follow along below.

```bash
mkdir uniswap
cd uniswap
npx truffle init
npm init
npm i --save @uniswap/v2-core
npm i --save @uniswap/v2-periphery
```

If you check out the following directory:
```bash
ls node_modules/@uniswap/v2-periphery/contracts
```

You'll see the Uniswap V2 smart contracts, and build artifacts. Now to create the actual contracts.

```bash
mkdir contracts/interfaces
touch contracts/interfaces/ILiquidityValueCalculator.sol
touch contracts/LiquidityValueCalculator.sol
```
