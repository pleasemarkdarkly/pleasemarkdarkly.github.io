circa 1998. In an effort to understand digital audio, I purchased a Micronas 3507D fixed function decoder and built an MP3 Player using the output of a file through a PC parallel port. The Micronas 3507D is a single-chip MPEG 1/2 layer 2/3 audio decoder with a high- performance DSP with a memory word length of 20 bits used in audio broadcast or memory-based playback applications.  Writing a file to the parallel port, I had a PIC microcontroller read the bytes and serialize them into the DSP.
