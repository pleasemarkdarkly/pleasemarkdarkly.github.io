_Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) and You._

__TLDR__

Bitcoin's (BTC) smallest unit is called a Satoshi, which is one hundred millionth of a single Bitcoin or 0.00000001 BTC.  Bitcoins are effectively a list of unspent transactions associated with a public key. Bitcoin address uses the address private keys sign, thus verifying, ownership to transfer Satoshis from one address to another. The history of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) allow anyone to verify the entire life of each Satoshis from its __coinbase__ when it was awarded to a miner to the owner. This property of each Bitcoin address having associated transaction ids rather some magic number of say, dollars, in an account verifiable by a ledger shared by the world instead of in the control of a government or bank is what make Bitcoin unique.

The long version.

Bitcoin wallets are complicated. Checkout the other posts about other aspects of Bitcoin, such as [See also Multi-Signature Wallets]({% post_url 2021-04-23-multisig %}). This post is about what is a Bitcoin or rather, what does the Bitcoin wallet contain which conveys your balance? To explain this, we have do first discuss the Bitcoin address scheme, why it was used, how it is secure, and then what does is decrypt on the blockchain which enables the representation of Bitcoin. 

First, the Bitcoin address scheme is a public and private key pair enabling you to decrypt a set of transactions on the blockchain. As not to go off on a tangent, a detailed explanation of [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) is super simplified to basically huge prime numbers which one part is public and the other part is private and by using someone elses public key and your private key, you can generate a message that only that person can decrypt with their private and your public key. The main point of all of this is that the size of the public/private key pairs are so large, 2 to the power of 256 or 

`115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936` 

possibilities, it is considered impossible to randomly guess the same public/private key pair - given random is something more complicated than using entropy of 'pa$$word'.

Keys use some random input (or rather should) and apply [SHA256](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/SHA-256) to generate the public/private key pair. This SHA256 takes an arbitrary input and generates 256 bits of data, unique to this one-way algorithm is that very small changes in the input create very large differences in the output. 

Have you noticed that when you generate an address pair, the result is not checked against a registry? The idea of the same address pair being checked, like whether an email has been previously taken, is called a 'collision'. 

This number is so unfathomably large, that the best explanation of how massive this number is was best illustrated by [YouTuber Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) specifically his video ["How secure is 256 bit security"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY).

So now that we understand how secure the addresses are, what do they decrypt on the Bitcoin Blockchain? Using this Bitcoin Whale address, `1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ` we can see the following UTXOs:

```json
[
  {
    "txid": "b77bb9433d858876702915b25650db43d71cb86c5130854e1411b48aa09ee152",
    "vout": 0,
    "satoshis": 10269
  },
  {
    "txid": "7eb15ea941b4a522191512f9df6628c95518606c8a61b76db2392fc7f624f8e2",
    "vout": 0,
    "satoshis": 153600000000
  },
  {
    "txid": "3b2c2f291f0b721fc9d9689eb08b55f1ebd6bedb50488f86c72147eeada74610",
    "vout": 0,
    "satoshis": 96600000000
  },
  {
    "txid": "aa309965a8336420338693d4cef53ed2cd5a1d77507072b6128eb649ffa8d747",
    "vout": 0,
    "satoshis": 17329
  }
]
```

The above transactions have been truncated for illustrative purposes, but you can head over to [MultiSig Builder](https://stupefied-hopper-853f87.netlify.app/multisig-build.html) and enter the address after selecting MainNet and pushing 'Get UTXOs'.

The transactions contain a transactionId or [`txId`, `vout`](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv/bitcoin-sv/blob/7fd177c7c443ff7723d88c5465fbf39285388e30/src/primitives/transaction.h) combined with `satoshis` are the Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs). In the Bitcoin world, UTXOs is the same as "money" is to a normal person in the real world. What makes UTXOs in particular important is that in Bitcoin, Bitcoin or its divisible denominations, called Satoshis are awarded to miners. Also called the __coinbase__.

Transactions contain a number of pieces of information including version, lock time, input and outputs. Without going down another tangent, the important idea is that given the Blockchain is public, it is possible to traverse every transaction with each address with the transaction id, Satoshis to its __coinbase__. 

As one can imagine, this is hardly the first time this topic has been discussed, so if you are interested in going down the [rabbit hole](https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works#:~:text=A%20transaction%20is%20a%20transfer,the%20owner%20of%20the%20wallet), here you go. You have been warned.
