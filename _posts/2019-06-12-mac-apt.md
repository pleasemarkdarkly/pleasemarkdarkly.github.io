[MacOSX forensic analysis framework containerized.](https://github.com/markedphillips/docker_mac_apt)

mac_apt is a python based framework, which has plugins to process individual artifacts (such as Safari internet history, Network interfaces, Recently used files, Spotlight typed searches..) The framework does the heavy lifting, parsing of disk/volume image and offers a unified output interface, which currently supports writing out data as CSV, Sqlite and Excel formats. There is an API which plugins can use to access files and folders within the disk image. Currently DD and E01 images are supported. DMG files without compression work too. You can use a mounted image too (with limited support on windows for this feature). We even put in a native HFS parser adding support for lzvn/lzfse compressed files.
