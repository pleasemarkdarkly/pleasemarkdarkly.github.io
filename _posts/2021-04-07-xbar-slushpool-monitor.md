_Monitor your Slushpool account via your macOS X menubar._

__TLDR__

See title.

The long version.

Well, that is about it. [Slushbar, XBar plugin here](https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/slushpool-xbar-plugin).

XBar is a BitBar reboot, [download BitBar here](https://github.com/matryer/xbar/releases/latest). A feature of XBar is an easier plug-in discovery and install method. For example, you can install the Slushbar with just [one-click here](https://xbarapp.com/docs/plugins/Cryptocurrency/slushpool.5m.js.html) and each plug-in has its own [xbarapp.com feature page](https://xbarapp.com/docs/plugins/Cryptocurrency/slushpool.5m.js.html).
