The first obvious application for mp3 was to convert a normal 1998 car stereo from a one CD player to a 11-disk mp3 player as 5-CD changers were obnoxiously expensive. A promising convergence product was Microsoft's First Generation AutoPC however the platform used the Hitachi SH3 Processor which turned out to be underwhelming in realtime audio playback.
