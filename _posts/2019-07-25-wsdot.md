[Pacific Northwest Collision Forecasting](https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/wsdot_visualization)

To better understand vehicle accidents in the Pacific Northwest, I processed the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT)â€™s data on serious to fatal accidents, mapped to the nearest intersections by the frequency, date and time.

Starting with data between 2015 through June 2018, I used Alteryx to generate forecasts, Python to apply a weight and Tableau for visualization. The result is a distribution of historical and forecasted collisions. The following is the `merger.py` script which produces the forecast from the WSDOT weighing each day by the weekday coefficient and preparing the visualization information for Tableau.

```python
import datetime as dt
import calendar
import pandas as pd
import dateutil
import datetime

print pd.__version__

def next_weekday(d, weekday=0):
    days_ahead = weekday - d.weekday()
    if days_ahead <= 0: # Target day already happened this week
        days_ahead += 7
    return d + datetime.timedelta(days_ahead-7)

# Opening the king county dataset
dataset = open("king.csv","r").read().split("\n")[1:][:-1]

# Just for bad entries stats
noint = 0
bad = 0

data = []

# Parsing the dataset to get the city and weekdate for each accident
for line in dataset[:-1]:
	line = line.split(",")
	city = line[2]
	if len(city) == 0:
		bad += 1
		continue
	date = line[14]
	if len(date) == 0:
		bad += 1
		continue
	dum = date.split("/")
	if len(dum[0]) == 1: date = "0"+date
	dum = date.split("/")

	if len(dum[1]) == 1: date = dum[0]+"/0"+dum[1]+"/"+dum[2]
	# We want to get the monday of that week, and not the actual date, so we can ARIMA by week (since by day would be less precise)
	date = dt.datetime.strptime(date,"%m/%d/%Y")
	weekdate = next_weekday(date)

	data.append([city, weekdate, calendar.day_name[date.weekday()]])


cities = set(zip(*data)[0])
min_date = min(zip(*data)[1])
max_date = max(zip(*data)[1])

delta = max_date - min_date

dates = []

for i in range(int(delta.days/7)+1):
    dates.append(min_date + datetime.timedelta(7*i))

df = pd.DataFrame(index=dates, columns=cities).fillna(0)
df.index.name = "Date"
for entry in data:
	df.set_value(str(entry[1]),entry[0],df[entry[0]][entry[1]]+1)

df.to_csv("weekly_table.csv")

# Now we want the weekday table. This table will have coefficients based on historical data per weekday. The ARIMA forecast will account for the whole week, and to get the prediction for a day the ARIMA number will be multiplied for the coefficient for that weekday for that city.

weekdays_name = set(zip(*data)[2])


df = pd.DataFrame(index=weekdays_name, columns=cities).fillna(0.)
df.index.name = "Weekday"
for entry in data:
	df.set_value(str(entry[2]),entry[0],float(df[entry[0]][entry[2]]+1))

for column in cities:
	total = df[column].sum()
	for row in weekdays_name:
		df.set_value(row, column, float(df[column][row])/total)

df.to_csv("weekday_coeffs.csv")
```
