I had the pleasure of working with [Natasha Pankina Illustrations](https://natasha-pankina.com) for a month to build her own online illustrations store.  With tens of thousands of stock vectors, she needed a way to house, encode, format, watermark, fingerprint, and merchandise her works of art. The result is a highly customized Wordpress e-commerce store.  She has an easy to use upload her vectors. The site automatically processes the EXIF data as does Shutterstock to set all the store variables, categories, and licenses.  The system ingests the content, autocreates all the online resources, and license formats, and certain product queues allow for seasonal banner ads to automatically rotate in for merchandising. On the backend, is Glusterfs mounted on to a Docker Swarm, ready to scale, as demand requires.  What are you waiting for? Buy something!
