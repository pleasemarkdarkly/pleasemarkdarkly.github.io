I worked with artist [Natasha Pankina Illustrations](https://natasha-pankina.com) to build her own online illustrations store.  

With tens of thousands of stock vectors, Natasha needed a way to automatically generate the myriad of formats her clients required.  It was important to provide the same experience as Adobe's Shutterstock while delivering value by purchasing from the artist directly. The result is a highly customized Wordpress e-commerce store.  

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/natasha-2.png" alt="natasha misc" style="width: 500px;"/></div>

Natasha has an easy to use workflow to upload her vector artwork, assign acceptable licensing schemes and she is done. The asset ingestion task takes less than a minute before the asset is watermarked and deployed to social media and customers can purchase any permutation of her artwork.  

Wordpress runs in a Docker Swarm with Gluster fs ready to scale as demand requires.
