I had the pleasure of working with [Natasha Pankina Illustrations](https://natasha-pankina.com) for a month to build her own online illustrations store.  With ten of thousands of stock vectors, she needed a way to house, encode, format, watermark, fingerprint, and merchandise her works of art. The result is a highly customized Wordpress online store. On the backend, is Glusterfs mounted on to a Docker Swarm. What are you waiting for? Buy something!
