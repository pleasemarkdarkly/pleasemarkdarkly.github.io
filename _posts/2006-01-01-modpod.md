With the vision of creating an instore and at home experience for content distribution. Greenplay was an end-to-end system with content licensing, all North American music and Warner Brothers/Paramount video content, merchandising in-store DVD/HD-DVD/Bluray product sales, music downloads, and at home streaming content on Greenplay set top boxes. The below instore PODs and at home players were developed.

Studio approved video content purchsae and rental through SD cards and PC peripherals, including $99 video player. 

In 2000, after the wide spread adoption of Napster and RIAA Lawsuits against the Rio mp3 player, large scale mp3 downloads was impacting the retail businesses behind content distribution.  One such company Transworld Entertainment hired me to develop hardware which enabled better recommendations and merchandising in store. The listening and viewing station was born and this system was the largest deployed of its kind, due entirely to the cost, power over ethernet, and deployment of the system. Transworld while innovative in merchadising, failed to follow through with a pure digital experience for their customers.
