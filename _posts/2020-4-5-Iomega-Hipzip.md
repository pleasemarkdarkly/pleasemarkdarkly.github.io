Over the course of the next few weeks, I'll be publishing code from Interactive Objects, Fullplay Media Systems, A DOT Corporation, and MOD Systems. For example, the code base for the Iomega Hipzip, which we called Dadio OS internally at Fullplay is [here](https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/iomega_hipzip).
