With [dotfiles](https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/bootstrap) being all the rage, I thought I would shove together my config. While it's far from complete, what I did that I wish others would do, is break up the various program installs into files, i.e. apt, brew, npm, git, gem, are seperated into .list files. For example, this pattern is pretty useful. 

```bash
prereqs=(
 bash-completion
 curl
 fonts-powerline
 fzf
 git
 htop
 iperf
 lynx
 mosh
 nano
 nfs-common
 nfs-server
 powerline
 rclone
 silversearcher-ag
 sshfs
 sudo
 tldr
 tmux
 wget
 zsh
}
```

Which can be easily looped through.

```bash
function install_prereqs () {
  for app in "${prereqs[@]}"
  do
    log_info "installing: $app"
    case $( "${UNAME}" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') in
      linux*)
        apt install -y $app
        ;;
      darwin*)
        brew install $app & brew upgrade $app
        ;;
      *)
        ;;
    esac
  done
  apt --fix-broken install
  apt-get update -y; apt autoremove
}
```




I also include a Dockerfile which I used to test the installation process and for others to watch the install before trying it out on their machine. This setup fetches some config files from my servers, so you will want to read all the wgets and make sure you are comfortable with what my script is doing. As always, don't trust my scripts, read them for yourself!
