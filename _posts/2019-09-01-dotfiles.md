With [dotfiles](https://github.com/pleasemarkdarkly/bootstrap) being all the rage, I thought I would shove together my config. While it's far from complete, what I did that I wish others would do, is break up the various program installs into files, i.e. apt, brew, npm, git, gem, are seperated into .list files. I can easily update them with either my latest list or tweak them. It seems that while lots of people have pretty interesting setups, its effort to try some else's dotfiles then update them with our own twist. That said, I also include a Dockerfile which I used to test the installation process and for others to watch the install before trying it out on their machine. This setup fetches some config files from my servers, so you will want to read all the wgets and make sure you are comfortable with what my script is doing. As always, don't trust my scripts, read them for yourself!
