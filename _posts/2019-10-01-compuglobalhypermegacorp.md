[Compuglobalhypermegacorp](https://compuglobalhypermegacorp.com)'s CEO Mr. Whiskers's World Domination Token, the MEOW Coin.  My friends were asking me about what cryptocurrency they should invest in, with many of them lementing they already missed the bus. To make some of them feel better, I created MEOW so I could give all my friends millions of tokens. In fact, you don't have to be a friend, I'll send you a bunch of MEOWs, just ping me.

[Mr. Whiskers’ Whitepaper](https://github.com/compuglobalhypermegacorp) on **Proof of Meow®** – provides solutions to classical computer science’s intractable problems including O(k^n), O(2^n), exponential; O(n!), factorial; and O(n^n ), super-exponential in “meow, hiss, purr, meow”.* [Etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4ed4DDd7981e347b673f697DC821965A3EB64b9c)
