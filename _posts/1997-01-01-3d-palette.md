**About University**
 
 Between 1994 and 1997, [I](http://www.hitl.washington.edu/people/alumni.php.html) had the privileged of working with [Mark Billinghurst](http://empathiccomputing.org/team/mark-billinghurst/), [Ivan Poupyrev](http://www.ivanpoupyrev.com/) and many super interesting individuals at the [Human Interface Technology Lab (HTML)](http://www.hitl.washington.edu/). The University of Washington research lab was led by the famous, [Thomas A. Furness III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_A._Furness_III), also known as the "Grandfather of Virtual Reality" - make no mistake, I am absolutely name-dropping here. 
 
 I graduated from the [Comparative History of Idea's (CHID)](https://chid.washington.edu/clowes-center) department, now called the Clowes Center for Conflict and Dialog Studies, after [James Clowes](https://chid.washington.edu/program-history). Clowes was my department head, he encouraged my circuitous route through college.  Roaming from CHID to [Architecture](https://arch.be.uw.edu/) to [Computer Science](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) and back again. After my first year, Jim signed off on my experiment with Architecture. Confused why 1996 Architecture did not require any 3D modeling or CAD knowledge, I withdrew, and wandered into CS. After learning how to program, I found myself at the HITL working for Billinghurst.
 
 We had access to amazing equipment such as the [SGI Onyx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_Onyx), piles of [VirtualIO glasses](https://vrtifacts.com/1995-virtual-io-i-glasses/), [Polhemus](https://polhemus.com/) trackers, and a Wacom Pad. The hardware was used in a variety of research avenues, one of which Billinghurst details in a 3D content creation tool detailed in the following paper.

Ultimately, I wrote my CHID senior thesis on the phenomenon of 'Smurf' conditioning, where as the name suggests, I analysed the Smurfs from the perspective of Plato's Republic. Clowes accepted my 'Smurf-thesis' along with my aborted efforts in Architecture, and the aforementioned ACM "contribution" to allow my timely graduation. I am significantly underselling the work involved with Architecture as well as a number of the software projects I was required to write for my classes.

Additionally, I worked on the HITL's [GloveGrasp](http://www.hitl.washington.edu/research/multimodal/GestureGRASP.html) which streamed glove data positional data to a host machine for use in virtual reality.
