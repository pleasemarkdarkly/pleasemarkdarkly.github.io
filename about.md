I am a pusher of buttons physically and metaphorically.  

I love technology; all spectrums from smartwatches to supercomputers, desktop software to web apps, embedded technology, consumer applications, devOps, orchestration, processor design, web apps , and triathlons. Recently, I've been emersed in cryptocurrency, concensus mechanisms, zero knowledge proofs, cryptoeconomics and consumer blockchain applications.

You can contact me for coffee or a "what's up" email. Or try any of the social media platforms to "poke", "tweet", "dm", "pm", or "snap" me.
